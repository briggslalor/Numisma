## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide the everyday investor with the knowledge and tools to invest in the future without putting all their eggs in one basket.

## Executive Summary

As our mission states, we have created a new tool that allows our investors to invest in crypto with simplicity, cost reduction and decentralization using ERC721 standards. 

In our interactive MVP application, the investor can invest in three options. This app will give you the option of yield farm index [FarmDex], metaverse index [MetDex]and large coin index [VentiDex] using our asset allocation model using the modern portfolio theory. You will also be able to connect your ganache to purchase the invesment and take a realtime photo to buy and register your investment on the blackchain. 

1) Learn

2) Add loops to automate  most efficient model,

3) Add features to include injury status, QB efficiency and weather components

4) Once games are played, we will automate scores from the internet to place the incorrect teams to re-run the model

...to enhance our user experience. Please enjoy and may the Praedico be with you!

## Requirements

import CryptoDownloadData as coinData
import pandas as pd

from pycoingecko import CoinGeckoAPI
cg = CoinGeckoAPI()


$ pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir
$ pip install streamlit-aggrid
$ Pip install tweepy
$ pip install cufflinks --upgrade
$ pip install chart_studio


Installation instructions
$ pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir
$ pip install streamlit-aggrid
$ Pip install tweepy
This project leverages python 3.7 Streamlit and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.

2. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn
    pip install streamlit

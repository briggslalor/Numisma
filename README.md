This project leverages python 3.7 Streamlit and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.

2. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...
